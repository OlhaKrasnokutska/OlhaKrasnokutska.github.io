  <div className='about-me'>
  <div>Iâ€™m UkrainianðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ And Iâ€™m proud of it.</div>
  <br />
  <div>But with hard times come hard decisions. Our decision was to protect our children and find the safety place for them.<br />We have found such in Sweden. And now itâ€™s time for me to find the job. </div>
  <br />
  <div>I had rather big career break because of parental leave. Before it I worked as Senior Cashier at the bank.<br />Iâ€™m thankful for this experience. I got very useful for any job personal skills there. I gained strong communication skills when dealing with clients, team members and supervisors.<br />Some conflict situations taught me stress resistance and the ability to think creatively, react quickly and set priorities in processes. But Iâ€™d like to make a career change.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Iâ€™ve always liked problem-solving. Even at school I took part in all possible competitions in mathematics and logic.<br />I always paid attention to details. I want to work in an environment that excites and challenges me, where I will be continually learning.<br />And I feel that Frontend development is exactly for me.</div>
  <br />
  <div>  After the war in Ukraine started, I got the opportunity to try Frontend. I have been fully supported by the SheCodes Foundation to complete the SheCodes Workshop.<br />I successfully graduated from SheCodes Basics, SheCodes Plus, SheCodes Responsive and SheCodes React courses. And realized that I want to continue learning.<br />Later I applied for The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy (IBM SkillsBuild) and successfully graduated from it.</div>
  <br />
  <div>I want to note that Iâ€™m quite successful in online work, Iâ€™m highly motivated, initiative, fast learning, assertive and good in time-management.</div>
  <br />
  <div>I feel that my personal skills and technical skills that I gained (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, JQuery, Apiâ€™s, Git, GitHub, Flexbox, SEO, and of course, Javascript, CSS, HTML5) would enable me to be an excellent candidate for Frontend developer.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Thank you for your time and consideration. If youâ€™re searching for a good employee - I look forward to hearing from you!!!</div>
